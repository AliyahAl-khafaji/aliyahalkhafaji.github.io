          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            We started Pacific Trails Resort 30 years ago with a dream and some
            determination. We have gone through many ups and downs throughout
            the years but thanks to all of you the resort is flourishing. We
            envisioned this place as the ultimate getaway from reality and city
            life, with luxury camping and many activities reconnecting with
            nature is at the forefront.

          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Here at Pacific Trails Resort we aim to help you forge a connection
            with nature while creating lasting memories. We hope that our resort
            will bring you comfort, relaxation, and the rejuvenation, and a deep
            sense of community. We have something here for everyone, and we
            tailor every vacation to your specific needs for ease and peace of
            mind.
